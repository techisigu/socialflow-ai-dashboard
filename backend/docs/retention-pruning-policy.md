# Data Retention and Pruning Policy

This document is the source of truth for retention behavior in the backend.

## Scope and ownership

- Runtime config source: `backend/src/config/config.ts`
- Retention config assembly: `backend/src/config/runtime.ts`
- Pruning engine: `backend/src/retention/dataPruningService.ts`
- Scheduler job: `backend/src/jobs/dataPruningJob.ts`
- Manual runner entrypoint: `backend/src/scripts/data-pruning.ts`

## Retention targets and default windows

The pruning engine handles two categories.

| Category        | Default path targets | Default retention window | Config keys                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logs            | `logs`               | `30` days                | `DATA_RETENTION_LOG_DAYS`, `DATA_RETENTION_LOG_PATHS`             |
| Analytics files | `data/analytics`     | `90` days                | `DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_DAYS`, `DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_PATHS` |

Notes:

- Paths are comma-separated lists; each path is resolved relative to backend process `cwd` when not absolute.
- Eligibility is based on file `mtime` (last modified time), not filename date or creation time.
- Missing target paths are skipped with a warning; pruning continues for remaining paths.

## Operational behavior

- Scheduler start: automatic when backend boots (`startDataPruningJob()` in server bootstrap).
- Scheduler gating: if `DATA_PRUNING_ENABLED=false`, scheduler is not started.
- Default cron: `DATA_PRUNING_CRON=0 2 * * *` (daily at 02:00 in server local timezone).
- Queue: BullMQ queue name defaults to `data-pruning` (`DATA_PRUNING_QUEUE`).

## Mode semantics

`DATA_RETENTION_MODE` supports `archive` and `delete`.

### `archive` mode (default)

- Eligible files are moved (`fs.rename`) from target paths to `DATA_RETENTION_ARCHIVE_DIR`.
- Category subfolders are added under archive root:
  - `<archive-dir>/logs/...`
  - `<archive-dir>/analytics/...`
- Relative path from the original target root is preserved.

Example:

- Source: `logs/api/2026-01-01.log`
- Archive root: `cold-storage`
- Archived location: `cold-storage/logs/api/2026-01-01.log`

### `delete` mode

- Eligible files are permanently removed (`fs.unlink`).
- No in-app recovery path exists after successful deletion.

## Safe dry-run workflow

There is currently no built-in `--dry-run` flag. Use the following safe simulation sequence.

### 1) Disable scheduler for testing window

Set:

```bash
DATA_PRUNING_ENABLED=false
```

This prevents automatic cron execution while you validate settings.

### 2) Test with `archive` mode and isolated paths

Use a non-production sandbox copy of your data and a temporary archive directory:

```bash
DATA_RETENTION_MODE=archive
DATA_RETENTION_ARCHIVE_DIR=tmp/pruning-dryrun-archive
DATA_RETENTION_LOG_PATHS=tmp/pruning-dryrun/logs
DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_PATHS=tmp/pruning-dryrun/analytics
```

### 3) Run pruning manually

From repo root:

```bash
npm run data-pruning
```

Or from `backend/` directly:

```bash
npm run build
npm run data-pruning:run
```

### 4) Validate result summary and moved files

Expect logs containing summary fields:

- `scannedFiles`
- `eligibleFiles`
- `archivedFiles`
- `deletedFiles`
- `skippedFiles`
- `errors`

Confirm moved files are only under your temporary archive root before enabling scheduled pruning.

## Rollback and recovery guidance

### If mode is `archive`

Rollback is file restore from archive location back to source root.

Recommended steps:

1. Keep scheduler disabled (`DATA_PRUNING_ENABLED=false`).
2. Restore archived files from `<archive-dir>/logs` and `<archive-dir>/analytics` to their original target roots.
3. Spot-check restored paths and counts.
4. Re-enable scheduler after verification.

### If mode is `delete`

Recovery depends on external backups only.

Recommended steps:

1. Immediately disable scheduler (`DATA_PRUNING_ENABLED=false`).
2. Restore deleted files from snapshots/backups.
3. Switch to `archive` mode for subsequent validation runs.
4. Re-enable schedule only after restore validation is complete.

## Production rollout checklist

1. Verify explicit path lists (`DATA_RETENTION_LOG_PATHS`, `DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_PATHS`).
2. Verify windows (`DATA_RETENTION_LOG_DAYS`, `DATA_RETENTION_ANALYTICS_DAYS`).
3. Start in `archive` mode.
4. Run one manual pruning cycle and inspect summary.
5. Confirm archive storage capacity and lifecycle policy.
6. Enable scheduler and monitor first scheduled execution logs.
